NAME
    POE::Filter::SAXBuilder - A POE Filter for parsing XML with XML::LibXML

SYSNOPSIS
      use POE::Filter::SAXBuilder;
      my $filter = POE::Filter::SAXBuilder->new();

      my $wheel = POE::Wheel:ReadWrite->new(
            Filter          => $filter,
            InputEvent      => 'input_event',
      );

DESCRIPTION
    POE::Filter::SAXBuilder is a POE Filter to turn an XML file or stream
    into a (series of) DOM tree (fragments). It uses the XML::LibXML modules
    to do the parsing and for the building of the DOM tree. This gives you
    very good support for most(all?) XML features, and allows you to use a
    host of extra modules available for use with XML::LibXML.

    To make the potentially time-consuming parsing process more compatible
    with the cooperative nature of POE, the filter will return a series of
    document fragments instead of the entire DOM tree in one go.

PUBLIC METHODS
    POE::Filter::SAXBuilder follows the POE::Filter API. This documentation
    only covers things that are special to POE::Filter::SAXBuilder.

  new()
    The constructor accepts a total of two arguments that both all optional:

    buffer
        a string that is XML waiting to be parsed (i.e. xml received from
        the wheel before the Filter was instantiated)

    handler
        a SAX Handler that implements the methods 'start_element',
        'end_element', (See POE::Filter::SAXBuilder::Builder for further
        information on creating your own SAX Handler)

BUGS AND NOTES
    Documentation for this sub project is as clear as mud.
